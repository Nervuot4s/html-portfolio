 <h1>The Best Movis According to Paulius</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
 <p>This is my favourite movie about magic. I love interaction between characters and progression of story during each year.</p>

 <h3>Altered Carbon</h3>
 <p>Really cool sci-fi TV series. In the series, I like how technology allows people to be almost immortal and how it depicts how it can shape people's lives.</p>

 <h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
 <p>This is my favourite movie about fantasy adventure. I really like the soundtrack and cinematic visuals of this film and how the group of adventurers managed to complete the task despite all the difficulties.</p>
